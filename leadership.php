                    <h3>1. Leadership Hindsight</h3>
                    <p>This involves reviewing the past to learn from the experiences of others and, most importantly, from <strong>self-evaluation</strong>. A leader who cannot reflect cannot grow.</p>

                    <h3>2. Leadership Foresight</h3>
                    <p>Once lessons are learned, a leader must look forward. Foresight is the ability to innovate and prepare for challenges before they arise.</p>

                <p>
                    We are tired of the narrative that African youth are "leaders of tomorrow." We believe they are <strong>partners of today.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    By combining the wisdom of the past (Hindsight) with the tools of the future (Foresight), we are equipping young people to solve local problems immediately.
